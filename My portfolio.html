<p align="center" style="color:white;font-family:Microsoft YaHei UI;font-size:20px">MY PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<ul>
<li>DATE OF BIRTH- 12/03/2002</li>
<li>I was born and brought up in Pune, Maharashtra</li>
<li>You will find my contact details at the end of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left" style="color:white;font-family:Tahoma">A small character sketch on myself-</p>         
<p align="left" style="color:white;font-family:Tahoma">I am the kind of person who cares deeply about most of the things or people around me. And as good as it sounds,
it really isn't so pretty at times because it leaves me vulnerable when I get too attached. Nonetheless, I really am grateful for what and who I have in my life. 
I'd like to say that I make a fairly good use of the opportunies thrown at me. That being said, it does take a lot to make up my 
mind when I'm planning to commit to something. But when I do, I put my heart and soul into it. I am not afraid of working hard. The single most important quality that 
I vlaue is "kindness", because I think being kind is underrated at times. It's a simple quality actually, but most people fail to incorporate it in their life styles 
due to some reason. Being kind actually encompasses most of the other ideals. Most importantly it makes you "human" and there shouldn't be any other way around it. 
So I appreciate this the most and strive to be kind myself first in whatever scenario, making a conscious effort sometimes, hoping that it'll come naturally to me 
every time, every day thereafter. </p>

<article id="vision">   
<p align="center" style="color:white;font-family:Microsoft YaHei UI;font-size:20px">MY VISION</p>
<p align="left" style="color:white;font-family:Tahoma">I won't say that I know just exactly what I'm going to do in life in about 10 years from now, but I do have a 
vague and positive idea about it all. Chemical engineering is something I chose to do by choice and I know I can make good use of what I learn in these 4yrs. I'd also 
like to emphasize the fact that while the branch we choose matters in some ways, anyone can learn anything in today's era. And so that's where the concept of 
"personal goals" comes in. I have a certain list of skills that I want to master in these 4yrs, be it academic or non-academic and irrespective of the fact if 
it's related to hard core chemical engineering. The way I see it, I want to develop skills that can help me excel in my field. Holistic development is essential 
in today's world. Also, mediocrity isn't an option. You need to stand out and for that you need to do "more". So, that's pretty much my vision for at least the 
next 4yrs. It could be anything, I could build up on the German that I learnt in School, look up coding, explore more of the music world, learn to cook..
the possibilities are endless. I just never want to stop learning in life because that's the essence of it.</p>
